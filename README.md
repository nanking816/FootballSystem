### TeamAssigner 

The TeamAssigner class is designed to automatically assign players to their respective teams (Team 1 / Team 2) based on their jersey colors which makes it suitable for scenarios like football match video analysis. It uses the K-Means clustering algorithm to extract color information from images and perform clustering, thereby determining which team each player belongs to.
